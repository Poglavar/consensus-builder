# 5n sandbox — Canton DevNet validator access

Machine-to-machine (M2M) access to the **5N Seaport shared `5n sandbox`**
validator's **JSON Ledger API v2**. This lets us deploy DARs, create contracts,
query the ACS, and stream updates **directly via API** — no Seaport browser UI
required for ledger operations.

> **Secret handling.** The OIDC **client secret is NOT in this file or in git.**
> It lives in `backend/.env` (gitignored) as `CANTON_CLIENT_SECRET`. Treat it like
> a production credential: it grants validator Ledger API access. **Never ship it
> to the browser** — see [Approach impact](#approach-impact).

## Endpoints

| Purpose | URL |
|---|---|
| Ledger REST API (v2) | `https://ledger-api.validator.devnet.sandbox.fivenorth.io/` |
| Ledger WebSocket | `wss://ledger-api.validator.devnet.sandbox.fivenorth.io` |
| OIDC token endpoint (Authentik) | `https://auth.sandbox.fivenorth.io/application/o/token/` |

## Auth — get a JWT (client_credentials)

- **Grant:** `client_credentials`
- **Client ID:** `validator-devnet-m2m`
- **Client Secret:** in `backend/.env` (`CANTON_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- **Audience:** `validator-devnet-m2m`
- **Scope:** `daml_ledger_api`
- **Token TTL:** **8 hours** (`expires_in=28800`) → app must detect 401 and refresh.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://auth.sandbox.fivenorth.io/application/o/token/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data 'client_id=validator-devnet-m2m' \
  --data "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --data 'audience=validator-devnet-m2m' \
  --data 'scope=daml_ledger_api'
```

## Use the API

```bash
# REST: pass the JWT as a Bearer token
curl 'https://ledger-api.validator.devnet.sandbox.fivenorth.io/v2/state/ledger-end' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# WebSocket: subprotocols, ORDER MATTERS: jwt first, then daml.ws.auth
wscat --connect 'wss://ledger-api.validator.devnet.sandbox.fivenorth.io/v2/state/active-contracts' \
  -s 'jwt.token.<token>' -s 'daml.ws.auth'
```

The server-side client (`backend/canton/`) drives all of this; `node backend/canton/check.js`
exchanges the token, optionally uploads the DAR, and runs the full purchase flow
(config from `backend/.env`).

## CCView — data indexing APIs

Canton data indexing / explorer APIs (docs at https://docs.ccview.io). Key in
`backend/.env` (`CCVIEW_API_KEY`). **DevNet host is `https://devnet.ccview.io`** —
the bare `ccview.io` is mainnet and rejects the devnet key with
`API_KEY_NETWORK_MISMATCH`. Auth header: `X-API-Key`.

CCView indexes Canton **Network/economic** data (Canton Coin balances, transfers,
rewards, validators, ANS, governance) — **not** application contracts, so it can't
list our proposals (we read those from the ledger ACS directly). It *is* the easy
way to read **Canton Coin balances** (relevant to M4 funds).

```bash
curl "https://devnet.ccview.io/api/v4/parties/<party>" -H "X-API-Key: $CCVIEW_API_KEY"
```

### Canton Coin (M4 funds) notes

- Our validator/operator party `5nsandbox-devnet-2::1220a14ca128…` (= M2M user 6's
  primaryParty) **holds ~16.1M Canton Coin** on DevNet. We control it (user 6 can
  actAs it), so we can fund demo buyer parties by transferring from it.
- Canton Coin = **Amulet**, moved via the **token standard** (Holding /
  TransferInstruction / TransferFactory). Default is a **2-step transfer**
  (offer→accept); a **transfer pre-approval** makes it 1-step. DevNet also has a
  **tap** faucet (`sdk.amulet.tap`) for minting test coin.
- Integration needs the Amulet **registry/scan URL** for the 5n sandbox + the
  token-standard interface calls (or the Canton Wallet SDK). Since both sender and
  receiver can be parties we host (actable by user 6), no external signing needed.

### Spike findings (Canton Coin / cross-participant)

- ✅ **On-ledger token control confirmed.** Querying the `Holding` interface
  (`…:Splice.Api.Token.HoldingV1:Holding`) for our validator party via
  `/v2/state/active-contracts` returns holdings (incl. a `USDCx` test token, amount
  200, and a `faucet-usdcx-mint` workflow) — we can see/exercise holdings with the
  M2M token.
- ⛔ **Custom templates can't cross to a Loop wallet party.** Creating a
  `PurchaseProposal` with a Loop-wallet party (different participant) as observer
  fails with `PACKAGE_SELECTION_FAILED` — the other participant hasn't **vetted**
  `consensus-builder-daml`, and managed Loop wallets won't vet arbitrary packages.
  → App contracts stay custodial on our validator; the only cross-participant
  vocabulary with external wallets is the **token standard (Canton Coin)**.
- ⛔ **Blocker for real transfers:** the Amulet **registry/scan URL** for the 5n
  sandbox is not in the creds and not discoverable by hostname guessing
  (`scan.*.fivenorth.io` don't resolve; ledger host has no scan proxy). The
  token-standard transfer needs it to fetch the `TransferFactory`. **Ask the
  organizer for the scan/registry URL.**

## Verified so far — FULL FLOW on live DevNet ✅

The server-side client (`backend/canton/`, verified via `check.js`/`check-route.js`)
runs the **entire purchase flow** against the 5n sandbox:

- ✅ Token exchange (Authentik) → JWT, `expires_in=28800` (8h).
- ✅ `GET /v2/state/ledger-end`, `GET /v2/parties`, `GET /v2/users`.
- ✅ `POST /v2/packages` — **DAR deployed via API** (no Seaport browser UI needed).
- ✅ `POST /v2/parties` — allocated lens/owner/buyer on our validator.
- ✅ `POST /v2/users/6/rights` — self-granted `CanActAs`.
- ✅ `POST /v2/commands/submit-and-wait` — created cert + proposal, exercised Accept.
- ✅ Owner-as-observer **visibility confirmed**; Sale created, proposal archived.

### Auth/usage gotchas learned (important for the frontend/backend)

1. **Our Canton user is `"6"`** (`primaryParty = 5nsandbox-devnet-2::…`,
   `participant_admin`). Command submissions must set **`userId: "6"`** — a wrong
   `userId` returns a vague `403 "security-sensitive error"`.
2. **`actAs` rights are required per party.** Admin (upload/allocate) ≠ actAs.
   After allocating a party, grant `CanActAs` via
   `POST /v2/users/6/rights` with body `{userId:"6", rights:[{kind:{CanActAs:{value:{party}}}}]}`.
3. **Scope ACS queries** to one party + one template (`filtersByParty` +
   `TemplateFilter`). A wildcard query blows past the node's **200-element cap**
   (`413 JSON_API_MAXIMUM_LIST_ELEMENTS_NUMBER_REACHED`) because our primaryParty
   is a stakeholder on many shared contracts.
4. **Token TTL 8h** → detect `401` and refresh.

## Approach impact

These are **machine credentials**, not a per-user wallet. That changes two things:

1. **Backend proxy, not direct-browser.** Because the secret must never reach the
   browser, the client secret + token refresh belong in a **thin backend** that
   proxies Ledger API calls (or mints short-lived scoped tokens for the frontend).
   This revives §6 **option B** for anything beyond local dev.
2. **Party hosting for the MVP.** The M2M identity acts on **our** validator, so
   the simplest demo hosts the `lens` / `owner` / `buyer` parties **on the 5n
   sandbox** (allocated via `POST /v2/parties`) and drives them from the backend.
   True owner **self-custody** (owner's own Loop wallet on another participant,
   named as cross-participant observer over the shared synchronizer) remains the
   production direction, deferred past the hackathon MVP.

## Wallets & SDKs (Loop)

The **5N Loop wallet** is the self-custodial browser wallet for Canton (external
party ids, passkey). Its dApp SDK is **`@fivenorth/loop-sdk`**
([github](https://github.com/fivenorth-io/loop-sdk) ·
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fivenorth/loop-sdk)); the vendor-neutral
standard is **`@canton-network/dapp-sdk`** (CIP-0103).

- Loop **can**: `connect()` (real `party_id`), `getHolding()` (CC balance),
  `provider.transfer(recipient, amount, instrument)` (a real **Canton Coin
  payment** — this is the M4 piece, wallet-signed, no scan/registry URL needed),
  `submitTransaction()` for Splice/Utility DARs.
- Loop **cannot**: create/exercise our custom `consensus-builder-daml` contracts —
  it "only supports Splice + Utility DARs; no plan for third-party DARs." Confirms
  the `PACKAGE_SELECTION_FAILED` limit. So the app agreement stays custodial; Loop
  is usable for **identity + Canton Coin payments** only.
